        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>Effective Date: 15-07-2023</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Non-Personal Information</h3>
        <p>CloudySky does not collect any personal information when you use the App. The App functions solely based on
            the
            city name you enter to provide weather information.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Location Information</h3>
        <p>CloudySky does not access or collect your device's location information. The App relies on the city name you
            input to fetch the relevant weather data.</p>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Third-Party Weather Data Providers</h3>
        <p>To provide accurate weather information, CloudySky may use third-party weather data providers. However, these
            providers do not have access to your personal information through the App. Any data received from
            third-party
            providers is used solely for displaying weather details and is not stored or associated with identifiable
            information.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Third-Party Analytics</h3>
        <p>CloudySky may utilize third-party analytics services to gather non-personal information, such as App usage
            statistics, error reports, and general demographics. These services help us understand how users interact
            with
            the App, enabling us to improve its functionality and user experience. The information collected by these
            services is aggregated, anonymized, and does not identify individual users.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
        <p>CloudySky prioritizes the security of your information and takes reasonable precautions to protect it.
            However,
            please note that no method of transmission or storage over the internet can be 100% secure. While we strive
            to
            use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
            security.</p>

        <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>CloudySky is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any
            personal
            information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from
            a
            child under 13, we will take prompt steps to delete such information from our records.</p>

        <h2>5. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>CloudySky reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
            effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy in the App. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy
            periodically for any updates.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or CloudySky's privacy practices, please
